This report identifies exclusive features from the Semantic Core Language Model (SCLM) that can be integrated into KeystoneAI to enhance its existing architecture while staying aligned with its core goals of safety, autonomy, and logical transparency.

1. Hardened "Immutable Knowledge" Layer (Safety Goal)
While KeystoneAI currently distinguishes between ACTIVE+VERIFIED and PROPOSED facts , SCLM introduces a stricter concept of Immutable Constants.



Feature: A database flag is_immutable for facts that are fundamental system rules or physical constants (e.g., "a ball is round").


Keystone Integration: This would prevent Keystone’s Memory from ever accepting a revoke_fact or update_fact command on protected keys. This acts as a circuit breaker against "gaslighting" where a user or an autonomous loop might accidentally overwrite critical system parameters or ground truths.

2. Explicit Source Attribution for Responses (Transparency Goal)
KeystoneAI tracks "actors" in its audit logs , but SCLM’s roadmap proposes elevating this to Source-Aware Responses.



Feature: Stamping every learned fact with a user_id or session_id and using that data in conversation.


Keystone Integration: When Keystone retrieves a fact from memory to build a prompt, it could include the provenance.

Example: Instead of saying "The capital of Australia is Canberra," Keystone could say "According to user_01, the capital of Australia is Canberra."

Benefit: This is critical for multi-user safety, ensuring the AI does not treat one user's potentially biased input as a universal truth for another.

3. Subjectivity & Opinion Separation (Safety/Logic Goal)
SCLM Phase 12 outlines a framework for handling Subjectivity.

Feature: Distinguishing between declarative_fact (objective) and has_opinion (subjective preference).

Keystone Integration: Integrating a new relationship type in the Memory core specifically for opinions.

Safety Protocol: Keystone’s ResponseEngine could be programmed to prioritize objective facts. If only an opinion is found (e.g., "I like dogs better than cats"), the AI would be forced to attribute it rather than adopting it as its own internal "logic".

4. Deterministic Reasoning Engine (Logic Goal)
SCLM Phase 11 proposes a ReasoningEngine for comparative logic (e.g., "Which is bigger, a basketball or a bus?").

Feature: Using structured data lookups to perform logical comparisons rather than relying on LLM "feelings" or hallucinations.


Keystone Integration: This could be implemented as a specialized Core (similar to ProbabilityCore or OptimizationCore). When the Intent detector identifies a comparison query, the system would query the Memory for object attributes (size, weight) and perform a mathematical comparison, only using the LLM to format the final sentence.


5. Semantic Telemetry for Explainability (Autonomy Goal)
Keystone currently uses autonomy_why to explain action choices based on PDDL goals. SCLM takes this further by deconstructing language into a "Core Thought".


Feature: Translating natural language into a structured, language-agnostic JSON "thought" (agent, action, object, mood) before processing.

Keystone Integration: By requiring the LLM to first output a structured "Core Thought" JSON before generating a final response, you gain a deep diagnostic layer.

Benefit: If Keystone makes a mistake, you can see exactly where the logic failed: was it a bad parse (wrong subject), a bad memory lookup (wrong fact), or a bad generation (wrong tone)? This mirrors Keystone's goal of Explainable Reasoning.
